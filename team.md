#The Team#
##Ming Juan##
I am proficient in C++ and Java and I am beginning to grow more interest in web design. So far, I have worked a bit with HTML/CSS and very basic Python coding. I currently have a minor in Mathematics, so I also have a strong background in math. I am looking forward to working with you all to get this awesome project up and running.

##Sharif Kabir##
I am proficient in C++, have worked a bit with python and I also have experience in working with SQL. I have some knowledge of HTML/CSS as well. I am a member of the team “HeatMapWizzards” and I believe the project can be a gamechanger. I will contribute whatever knowledge I have of HTML and CSS and I hope to learn Javascript from my awesome teammates in the process. I also find math very interesting and I hope to use my analytical knowledge to help our team and get this project up and running.

##Gwenaël Gatto##
I am a computer science major with a background in math. My language of choice is c++, but I learned some basic java, SQL, Perl, and bash. This project is very interesting and I am excited to work on data visualization. I look forward to making a heatmap webpage with my team members.
